Ubersystem Deploy Repository
============================

This repo contains intermediate configuration/setup data for installing ubersystem.  Whenever possible, you should use the following instead: https://github.com/magfest/simple-rams-deploy

It will check out a bunch of git repos and is the basis for both Vagrant setups and also production deployments.

Docs are WIP, more a coming soon. If you need any help here, email code at magfest dot org.
