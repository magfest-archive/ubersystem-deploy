# == Class: logstash
#
# This class is able to install or remove logstash on a node.
# It manages the status of the related service.
#
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*ensure*]
#   String. Controls if the managed resources shall be <tt>present</tt> or
#   <tt>absent</tt>. If set to <tt>absent</tt>:
#   * The managed software packages are being uninstalled.
#   * Any traces of the packages will be purged as good as possible. This may
#     include existing configuration files. The exact behavior is provider
#     dependent. Q.v.:
#     * Puppet type reference: {package, "purgeable"}[http://j.mp/xbxmNP]
#     * {Puppet's package provider source code}[http://j.mp/wtVCaL]
#   * System modifications (if any) will be reverted as good as possible
#     (e.g. removal of created users, services, changed log settings, ...).
#   * This is thus destructive and should be used with care.
#   Defaults to <tt>present</tt>.
#
# [*autoupgrade*]
#   Boolean. If set to <tt>true</tt>, any managed package gets upgraded
#   on each Puppet run when the package provider is able to find a newer
#   version than the present one. The exact behavior is provider dependent.
#   Q.v.:
#   * Puppet type reference: {package, "upgradeable"}[http://j.mp/xbxmNP]
#   * {Puppet's package provider source code}[http://j.mp/wtVCaL]
#   Defaults to <tt>false</tt>.
#
# [*status*]
#   String to define the status of the service. Possible values:
#   * <tt>enabled</tt>: Service is running and will be started at boot time.
#   * <tt>disabled</tt>: Service is stopped and will not be started at boot
#     time.
#   * <tt>running</tt>: Service is running but will not be started at boot time.
#     You can use this to start a service on the first Puppet run instead of
#     the system startup.
#   * <tt>unmanaged</tt>: Service will not be started at boot time and Puppet
#     does not care whether the service is running or not. For example, this may
#     be useful if a cluster management software is used to decide when to start
#     the service plus assuring it is running on the desired node.
#   Defaults to <tt>enabled</tt>. The singular form ("service") is used for the
#   sake of convenience. Of course, the defined status affects all services if
#   more than one is managed (see <tt>service.pp</tt> to check if this is the
#   case).
#
# [*version*]
#   String to set the specific core package version you want to install.
#   Defaults to <tt>false</tt>.
#
# [*contrib_version*]
#   String to set the specific contrib package version you want to install.
#   Defaults to <tt>false</tt>.
#
# [*restart_on_change*]
#   Boolean that determines if the application should be automatically restarted
#   whenever the configuration changes. Disabling automatic restarts on config
#   changes may be desired in an environment where you need to ensure restarts
#   occur in a controlled/rolling manner rather than during a Puppet run.
#
#   Defaults to <tt>true</tt>, which will restart the application on any config
#   change. Setting to <tt>false</tt> disables the automatic restart.
#
# The default values for the parameters are set in logstash::params. Have
# a look at the corresponding <tt>params.pp</tt> manifest file if you need more
# technical information about them.
#
# [*package_url*]
#   Url to the package to download.
#   This can be a http,https or ftp resource for remote packages
#   puppet:// resource or file:/ for local packages
#
# [*contrib_package_url*]
#   Url to the contrib package to download.
#   This can be a http,https or ftp resource for remote packages
#   puppet:// resource or file:/ for local packages
#
# [*software_provider*]
#   Way to install the packages, currently only packages are supported.
#
# [*package_dir*]
#   Directory where the packages are downloaded to
#
# [*purge_package_dir*]
#   Purge package directory on removal
#
# [*package_dl_timeout*]
#   For http,https and ftp downloads you can set howlong the exec resource may take.
#   Defaults to: 600 seconds
#
# [*logstash_user*]
#   The user Logstash should run as. This also sets the file rights.
#
# [*logstash_group*]
#   The group logstash should run as. This also sets the file rights
#
# [*purge_configdir*]
#   Purge the config directory for any unmanaged files
#
# [*service_provider*]
#   Service provider to use. By Default when a single service provider is possibe that one is selected.
#
# [*init_defaults*]
#   Defaults file content in hash representation
#
# [*init_defaults_file*]
#   Defaults file as puppet resource
#
# [*init_template*]
#   Service file as a template
#
# [*java_install*]
#  Install java which is required for Logstash.
#  Defaults to: false
#
# [*java_package*]
#   If you like to install a custom java package, put the name here.
#
# [*manage_repo*]
#   Enable repo management by enabling our official repositories
#
# [*repo_version*]
#   Our repositories are versioned per major version (1.3, 1.4) select here which version you want
#
# [*configdir*]
#   Path to directory containing the logstash configuration.
#   Use this setting if your packages deviate from the norm (/etc/logstash)
#
# [*install_contrib*]
#  Enable installation of the contrib package
#
# [*repo_stage*]
#   Use stdlib stage setup for managing the repo, instead of anchoring
#
# === Examples
#
# * Installation, make sure service is running and will be started at boot time:
#     class { 'logstash': }
#
# * Removal/decommissioning:
#     class { 'logstash':
#       ensure => 'absent',
#     }
#
# * Install everything but disable service(s) afterwards
#     class { 'logstash':
#       status => 'disabled',
#     }
